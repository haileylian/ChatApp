A full-stack chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Users can sign up, log in, and chat in real-time.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management and bcrypt for password hashing. Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely.
- **Real-time Messaging with Socket.IO**: Instant messaging functionality with Socket.IO, allowing users to send and receive messages in real-time without page reloads.
- **Online Users Display**: A dynamic display of online users so you can see who is available to chat.
- **Private Chats**: One-on-one private messaging between users, ensuring private conversations are kept confidential.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data, messages, and other application data.
- **Express.js**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js used to build the backend API.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the frontend of the application.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used to run the backend server.
- **Socket.IO**: Library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for securely transmitting information between the client and the server as a JSON object. It is used to verify the authenticity of users.
- **bcrypt**: Library to help hash passwords. It ensures that user passwords are stored securely in the database by encrypting them before saving.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Daisy UI**: UI components library built on TailwindCSS.
- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles.
